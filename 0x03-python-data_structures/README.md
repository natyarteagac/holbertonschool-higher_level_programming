# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the del statement and how to use it

## Requirements
## Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
## C
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your f functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

1. Secure access to an element in a list
2. Replace element
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
4. Replace in a copy
5. Can you C me now?
6. Lists of lists = Matrix
7. Tuples addition
8. More returns!
9. Find the max
10. Only by 2
11. Delete at
12. Switch
13. Linked list palindrome

## Compilation 
## Python
Example: ./0-main.py
